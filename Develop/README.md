Homework: Express

The front end of this homework has already been created, so it was my responsibility to create the routes for the backend for a notes app.

How to install: If you are in VSCode, you will need to open up your integrated terminal and do a "npm i" upon opening said terminal. I believe that it's possible to do this in gitbash, but I don't know, and therefore don't recommend it.

How to use the project: Most of the user actions are already on the HTML file, If you want to test the various methods, Use Insomnia: localhost:3001. No authentication should be needed.
